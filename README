= bootstrap-scripts

Provides various scripts for setting up the environments / context in which
many of the blog articles are based.  The Ubuntu scripts, especially, are 
typically executed on a just-installed Ubuntu server instance in a virtualized
server environment.  My basic philosophy is that each server should do one
thing and do that one thing well.  (database server, rails app server, DNS
server, and so on).
